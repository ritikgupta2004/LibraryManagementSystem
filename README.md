📚 Library Management System
.NET ASP.NET Core EF Core xUnit

An enterprise-grade, highly responsive Model-View-Controller (MVC) web application built with ASP.NET Core. This platform serves as a modern digital portal for libraries to track physical and digital assets, manage borrowing records, and streamline user administration.

✨ Key Features
Modern Glassmorphic UI: Beautifully crafted interface using advanced Bootstrap grids, hover animations, CSS gradients, and high-quality cover images.
Dynamic Asset Tracking: Complete CRUD lifecycle management for multiple asset types:
📖 Books
📰 Publications (Magazines & Newspapers)
Advanced Borrowing Engine: Track real-time item availability. Seamlessly manage checkout instances, overdue tracking, and return processing without manual data entry.
Identity & Authorization: Role-based access control with robust models for Librarians and Students.
Pagination & Search: High-performance querying using Entity Framework Core, providing instantaneous paginated results and search filtering.
Deterministic Unit Testing: Heavily tested controllers using xUnit and FluentAssertions with an InMemory Database provider for conflict-free CI/CD execution.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

Prerequisites
.NET 8.0 SDK (or later)
Visual Studio 2022, Rider, or VS Code.
Installation
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/aaryamanmodi353-rgb/Library-Management.git
cd Library-Management
Restore NuGet dependencies

dotnet restore
Apply Database Migrations The project uses EF Core Code-First migrations. Apply them to generate the local SQLite database (library.db):

dotnet ef database update
(Note: The database comes pre-seeded with sample books and publications for immediate testing).

Run the Application

dotnet run
Access the App Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5039 (or the port specified in your console output).

🧪 Running Unit Tests
The repository includes a dedicated test suite (TestProject1) built with xUnit to guarantee business logic integrity (e.g., verifying BooksController pagination and valid model states).

To execute the tests:

dotnet test
🏗️ Architecture Overview
The application follows a strict N-Tier MVC Architecture:

Models: Pure domain entities (Book.cs, BorrowRecord.cs) representing the database schema.
ViewModels: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) tailored specifically for Razor view binding (BookListViewModel.cs), ensuring the UI only receives the exact data it needs.
Controllers: Lean controllers responsible for HTTP routing, validating ModelState, and orchestrating database queries via LibraryContext.
Views: Razor pages leveraging partials and layouts (_Layout.cshtml) for a DRY, easily maintainable frontend.
